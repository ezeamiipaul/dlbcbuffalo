      Journalist Alan Isaacson provides a helpful study of this phenomenal ministry in his book 
      <em>“Deeper Life: The Extraordinary Growth of the Deeper Life Bible Church”</em>, after talking 
      with many members of the church who told him how Christ has miraculously intervened and changed 
      lives in response to prayer and the proclamation of the Gospel. In Pastor Kumuyi’s own words: 
      “God, in the growth of Deeper Life Bible Church, has strategically and prudently used miracles 
      to ‘make all men come to Him’ (John 3:26). We take Christian living and holiness seriously.”
    </p>

    <p class="font-body">
      According to Isaacson, the history of Deeper Life is very much the personal story of 
      W.F. Kumuyi. He is a gifted man, clear-thinking and humble. He is a dedicated Christian 
      and deserves the title ‘the man of God,’ which his followers have given him. Since he was 
      a young man, Kumuyi has devoted his time to reading and studying the Bible. He knows the 
      Scriptures inside out, and has struggled to understand and apply them. As he shares that 
      struggle and his love for the word of God, so people have been drawn to him for advice, 
      or simply to listen. When he preaches, his message is clear, simple, and profound. Poor 
      street traders who can barely read sit next to university professors, all equally captivated 
      by the way Scripture becomes suddenly relevant to them.
    </p>

    <p class="font-body">
      Pastor Kumuyi’s own Christian life developed because he took the Bible so seriously, and so 
      the Deeper Christian Life Ministry has developed in the same way. In Alan Isaacson’s own words, 
      he “preached Deeper Life into existence”. His sermons were captivating, wrote Isaacson, “I would 
      classify him as one of the greatest living preachers, giving a straightforward Bible-based message, 
      his sermons thorough, and always personally challenging. He always gave a wide range of cross-references 
      which were read in their context, supporting, clarifying and expanding his main points. He spoke clearly 
      and authoritatively to the Nigerian situation. He dealt sensitively with African culture, but also made 
      a firm stand in highlighting the points where local culture was incompatible with the will of God. While 
      stressing the high moral tone which is one of the virtues of most African cultures at their best, he was 
      at pains to specify those aspects of local culture which were unchristian and even evil. In this way he 
      was not only concerned with some kind of personal holiness, but also genuinely seeking the wholeness and 
      harmony of the community at large, where truth, honesty, and justice should be the predominant characteristics.”

          That Entire Sanctification is a definite act of God’s grace, subsequent to the New Birth, by which the believer’s heart is
          purified and made holy. It cannot be attained progressively by works, struggle or suppression, but it is obtained by faith in
          the sanctifying blood of Jesus Christ. Holiness of life and purity of heart are central to Christian living.
